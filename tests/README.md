# SQL Formatter Tests

These test files were written by the AI model to ensure the SQL formatter functionality works correctly with different SQL dialects and syntax patterns.

## Test Files

- `test-brackets-format.js` - Tests SQL formatting with bracket notation (table.[id]) to identify dialect compatibility issues
- `test-dialects.js` - Tests different SQL dialects to find which ones support bracket syntax for proper formatting

## Purpose

These tests were created to debug and resolve issues with SQL formatting when using brackets and periods in table/column names, ensuring the application handles various SQL dialects correctly.
